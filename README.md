# Full Stack Trivia API  Frontend

## Getting Setup 

> _tip_: this frontend is designed to work with [Flask-based Backend](../backend). It is recommended you stand up the backend first, test using Postman or curl, update the endpoints in the frontend, and then the frontend should integrate smoothly.

### Installing Dependencies

#### Installing Node and NPM

This project depends on Nodejs and Node Package Manager (NPM). Before continuing, you must download and install Node (the download includes NPM) from [https://nodejs.com/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

#### Installing project dependencies

This project uses NPM to manage software dependencies. NPM Relies on the package.json file located in the `frontend` directory of this repository. After cloning, open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install
```

>_tip_: **npm i** is shorthand for **npm install**

## Required Tasks

## Running Your Frontend in Dev Mode

The frontend app was built using create-react-app. In order to run the app in development mode use ```npm start```. You can change the script in the ```package.json``` file. 

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

```bash
npm start
```

## Request Formatting

The frontend should be fairly straightforward and disgestible. You'll primarily work within the ```components``` folder in order to edit the endpoints utilized by the components. While working on your backend request handling and response formatting, you can reference the frontend to view how it parses the responses. 

After you complete your endpoints, ensure you return to and update the frontend to make request and handle responses appropriately: 
- Correct endpoints
- Update response body handling 

## Optional: Styling

In addition, you may want to customize and style the frontend by editing the CSS in the ```stylesheets``` folder. 

## Optional: Game Play Mechanics

Currently, when a user plays the game they play up to five questions of the chosen category. If there are fewer than five questions in a category, the game will end when there are no more questions in that category. 

You can optionally update this game play to increase the number of questions or whatever other game mechanics you decide. Make sure to specify the new mechanics of the game in the README of the repo you submit so the reviewers are aware that the behavior is correct. 


# Full Stack Trivia API Backend

## Getting Started

### Installing Dependencies

#### Python 3.7

Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

#### Virtual Enviornment

We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organaized. Instructions for setting up a virual enviornment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

#### PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by naviging to the `/backend` directory and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages we selected within the `requirements.txt` file.

##### Key Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)  is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM we'll use handle the lightweight sqlite database. You'll primarily work in app.py and can reference models.py. 

- [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is the extension we'll use to handle cross origin requests from our frontend server. 

## Database Setup
With Postgres running, restore a database using the trivia.psql file provided. From the backend folder in terminal run:
```bash
psql trivia < trivia.psql
```

## Running the server

From within the `backend` directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

To run the server, execute:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=flaskr
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```

Setting the `FLASK_ENV` variable to `development` will detect file changes and restart the server automatically.

Setting the `FLASK_APP` variable to `flaskr` directs flask to use the `flaskr` directory and the `__init__.py` file to find the application. 


## Testing
To run the tests, run
```
dropdb trivia_test
createdb trivia_test
psql trivia_test < trivia.psql
python test_flaskr.py
```

Omit the dropdb command the first time you run tests.

## API Reference

### Getting Started
* Base URL: Currently this application is only hosted locally. The backend is hosted at [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/)
* Authentication: This version does not require authentication or API keys.

### Error Handling
Errors are returned as JSON in the following format:

```bash
{
    "success": False,
    "error": 404,
    "message": "Not Found"
}
```

The API will return four types of errors:
* 400 – Bad Request
* 404 – Not Found
* 422 – Unprocessable
* 500 - Internal Server Error
